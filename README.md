The "Ukrainian Word Generation" uses a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to create new Ukrainian words. 
The goal is to train a model that understands the structure of Ukrainian words and generates plausible new ones based on a given seed. 
It applies PyTorch for implementing the RNN, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
